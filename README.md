# NodeSchool.io Node Problems

This repository contains the solutions for learnyounode. You can install learnyounode as follows:

```
npm i -g learnyounode
```

The module contains a list of exercises. The solutions you come up with are checked against the module's solutions. Note my answers above in this repo do not contain the same solutions found in the module (after solving a problem, learnyounode will output it's master solution); however, it's always refreshing to find different ways to solve the same problems. Anyway, I hope people find this helpful.
